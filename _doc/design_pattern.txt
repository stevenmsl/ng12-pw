Angular Approach

- User enters data in an input element or
  checks a checkbox  
  - event handler triggered, and the value is
    stored as a property on the component
    class instance (collecting properties)

- User clicks a button to perform an action
  - event handler triggered, and we can use
    the properties collected earlier 
    to perform an action

- The action updates some properties on the
  class instance that will cause an update
  of other elements that binds to those 
  properties
